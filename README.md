# Spam Mail Prediction System
#### View Demo: https://spam-mail-prediction-sbxrmbpbr8hcwgst2x8nhm.streamlit.app/

## Project Description
The Spam Mail Prediction System is designed to classify emails as **spam** or **ham (non-spam)** based on their content. The system uses a **Logistic Regression model** to predict the likelihood that an email is spam, based on various features extracted from the email content.

### Features:
- **Email Classification**: Classifies emails as either spam or non-spam based on their content.
- **Logistic Regression Model**: Utilizes a Logistic Regression algorithm for binary classification.
- **Simple User Interface**: Allows users to input email content and get predictions regarding its classification.

---

## Technologies Used:
- **Python**: Programming language used for building the system.
- **Logistic Regression**: Machine learning algorithm used for spam classification.
- **Libraries**: 
  - `Scikit-learn`: For implementing Logistic Regression.
  - `Pandas`: For handling and preprocessing data.
  - `Numpy`: For numerical operations.
